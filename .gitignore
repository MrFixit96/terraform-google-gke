# Ignore any .tfvars files that are generated automatically for each Terraform run. Most
# .tfvars files are managed as part of configuration and so should be included in
# version control.
#
# example.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf
!*.auto.tfvars

####Force you to think about putting json files in this repo (ie. service account keys)
*.json

# .tfvars files (uncomment if these should not be stored ie. public repos)
*.tfvars
